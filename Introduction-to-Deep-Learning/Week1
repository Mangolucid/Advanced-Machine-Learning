Welcome to the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course! In the first week you'll learn about linear models and stochatic optimization methods. Linear models are basic building blocks for many deep architectures, and stochastic optimization is used to learn every model that we'll discuss in our course.

Key Concepts:
    Train a linear model for classification or regression task using stochastic gradient descent
    Tune SGD optimization using different techniques
    Apply regularization to train better models
    Use linear models for classification and regression tasks
