This module is an introduction to the concept of a deep neural network. You'll begin with the linear model and finish with writing your very first deep network.

Key Concepts:
    Explain the mechanics of basic building blocks for neural networks
    Apply backpropagation algorithm to train deep neural networks using automatic differentiation
    Implement, train and test neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras
